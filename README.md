# DLRRC: Deep Learning Radiomics Reproducibility Checklist

## Background

Computer science and hardware have developed prominently in this decade, advancing Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning applications in translational medicine. As an icon, DL-radiomics research mushrooms and solves several traditional radiological challenges. Behind the glory of DL-radiomics successful performance, there is limited attention to the neglected reproducibility of existing reports, which runs contrary to radiomics original intention, to realize unexperienced-dependent radiological processing with high robustness and generalization. Besides focusing on objective causes of reproduction barriers, deep-seated factors, between contemporary academic evaluation systems and scientific research, should also be mentioned.

Hence, there is an urgent need for a targeted inspection to promote this area's healthy development. Considering this, we propose a reproducibility specification checklist.

We also take Renal cell carcinoma, one of the common genitourinary cancers, as an example to glimpse the reproducibility defects in the whole DL-radiomics field. Specifically, we analyse the performance of existing DL-radiomics reports in RCC. The results show a trend of increasing reproducibility but still a need to further improve, especially in technological details of pre-processing, training, validation, and testing.
